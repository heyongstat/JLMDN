Joint Learning of Multiple Differential Networks with fMRI data for Brain Connectivity Alteration Detection

In this study we focus on the problem of joint learning of multiple differential networks with function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data sets from multiple research centers. As the research centers may use different scanners and imaging parameters, joint learning of differential networks with fMRI data from different centers may reflect the underlying mechanism of neurological diseases from different perspectives while capturing the common structures. We transform the task as a penalized logistic regression problem, and exploit sparse group Minimax Concave Penalty (gMCP)  to induce common structures among multiple differential networks and the sparse structures of each differential network. To further enhance the empirical performance, we develop an ensemble-learning procedure. We conduct thorough simulation study to assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed method and compare with  state-of-the-art alternatives. We apply the proposed method to analyze fMRI datasets related with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder from various research centers. The identified common hub nodes and differential interaction patterns coincides
with the existing experimental studies.
